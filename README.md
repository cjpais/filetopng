# filetopng
Write any file to a png to upload to google photos. This will allow you to store unlimited data on google photos. Could be good for backing up data.

This is some pretty old (and ugly code)
This ideally should be done in C, but is an old project at this point and completely unmaintained.
I would reccomend looking at the rewrite branch if you plan on using this.
